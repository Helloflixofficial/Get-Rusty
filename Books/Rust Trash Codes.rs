Relational Operators

Relational Operators check or define the relationship equavalency 
between two elements. Relational operators are used to compare two or more values. 
Relational operators return a Boolean value âˆ’ true or false.

x = 5
y = 2

Show Examples

      	Operator	Description	Example
1	>	Greater than	(x > y) is true
2	<	Lesser than	(x < y) is false
3	>=	Greater than or equal to	(x >= y) is true
4	<=	Lesser than or equal to	(x <= y) is false
5	==	Equality	(x == y) is false
6	!=	Not equal	(x != y) is true
////////////////////////////////////

Logical Operators

Logical Operators are used to combine and check two or more conditions. 

Logical operators return a Boolean value. 

Show Examples

x = 1
y = 2

Sr.No	Operator	Description	Example

1)	&& (And)	The operator returns true as long as 
all the expressions specified return true	
(x > 0 && y > 3) false

2)	||(OR)	The operator returns true if at least one of the expressions specified 
return true	(x > 0 || y > 3) true

3)	! (NOT)	The operator returns the inverse of the expressionâ€™s result. For E.g.: !(>5) 
returns false	!(x < 4 ) false

fn main() {
    let user = "todd";
    if user.len() == 4 {
        println!("pass");
    } else {
        println!("faild")
    }
}

// string litreals are statics  By defults . this ensure that string is valid
//for entaire duration  of the program  . you can explicitly declare the string  as stastic
